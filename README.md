# Frequency Distribution Analysis and Statistical Measures

## Overview
This Assignment of the Probability and Statistics demonstrates statistical analysis and visualization techniques for ungrouped and grouped datasets. It includes the construction of frequency distribution tables, calculation of statistical measures, and various data visualizations to better understand the data.

## Key Features
- **Ungrouped Data Analysis:**
  - Frequency distribution table
  - Graphical representations: Histogram, Bar Graph, Pie Chart, Frequency Polygon, and Ogive
  - Basic statistical measures: Mean, Median, Mode, Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles
  - Box and Whisker Plot with skewness interpretation

- **Grouped Data Analysis:**
  - Conversion of ungrouped data to grouped data
  - Statistical measures for grouped data: Arithmetic Mean, Harmonic Mean, Geometric Mean, Median, and Mode
  - Cumulative frequency analysis and class boundary representation
